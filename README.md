# What is this?
This will be a Nuxt Layer that will wrap `nuxt/ui` and provide reusable components with an opinionated style.
This should speed up the creation process of new websites and webapps, while establishing a consistent UI structure between them for better recognizability.

It will be structured in two type of components: **Elements** and **Units**. The first being single reusable elements within **Units**, the second being reusable components within Pages.

## Icons used
PH, Simple Icons

## Goal
The goal of this project is to provide a boilerplate with opinionated styling for most of my project. But as usual I'm happy to see contributions and make it fit for more people's needs.

# Docs
There are none at the moment.

# Notes
I'm currently using `app.vue` as a small playground to quickly check how components render.

# Contribute
